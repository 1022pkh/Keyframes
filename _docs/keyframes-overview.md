### **Image**

An `Image` in Keyframes consists of a number of important fields, which together, describe an animated and scalable image.  At the top level, an image contains information about how to scale (`canvas_size`) an image, as well as how to play back an animation at the correct speed (`frame_rate`, `frame_count`).  The animation itself is not bound to the discrete `frame_rate` that the image was extracted at, as the Keyframes rendering library supports fractional frames.  In addition to these global parameters of an `Image`, an `Image` also contains a number of `Feature`s, which describe different shapes to be drawn, as well as `Animation Group`s, which describe transforms that can be applied to multiple `Feature`s or even other `Animation Group`s at once.

Let's break down this simple image of a star against a circle scaling up and down.  The animation was exported at 24FPS, and the frame number is shown in the top left corner as well as the scale of the star on the bottom.

Let's slow that down a bit, frame by frame.

### **Features**

A `Feature` is any independent visual object of the image.  Most important, it includes shape drawing commands, presented very similary to SVG type commands, which describe the `Feature`'s shape at any given time.  A `Feature` may belong to a larger `Animation Group`, as well as contain features specific animations of its own, including a specialized `STROKE_WIDTH` animation.  The shape of a `Feature` can also change over time, using the same `Keyframe` and `Interpolator` pattern described below.

##### Shape

A shape is any list of line drawing commands, which strung together, describe a continuous line or closed shape that can be filled or stroked.  The commands are given as a series of `Move`, `Line`, `Quadratic`, and `Cubic` commands, one after another.

Here are the important shapes for the above image, along with vertices (squares) and control points (circles), if relevant.

### **Animations**

##### Transforms

The Keyframes rendering library includes support for the common matrix based transform operations, `SCALE`, `ROTATE`, and `TRANSLATE`.  For `Feature`s specifically, an additional non-matrix `STROKE_WIDTH` is available.  `Animation`s may belong to specific `Feature`s, or as part of a larger `Animation Group`.

##### Animation Progression

The values of a transform of an animation and how they change during the playback of an animation are determined by two key fields, `Keyframe`s and `Timing Curves`.  Using the combination of the two fields, we can calculate back a value for a transform at any specified time in the animation.

**Keyframes** are specific frames an the animation that have specific target vlaues.  For example, in scaling a shape up and back down over 10 frames, we will want to start and end at 100% scale at the 0th and 10th frame, and hit our max scale of 150% on the 7th frame.  In this example, our key frames for the `SCALE` transform for this shape would be `[0, 7, 10]` with the values `[100%, 150%, 100%` respectively.

**Timing Curves** describe the pace with which a transform changes between each keyframe.  Each timing curve is modeled as a cubic bezier curve from point `[0, 0]` to `[1, 1]`, where the X value is the progression in time from the origin keyframe to the destination keyframe, and the Y value describes the amount of change in the value at a given time: `origValue + (destValue - origValue) * Y`.

For our scaling star image, the graph of scale change over time looks like this, with vertices and timing curve in/out values shown.

### **Tying it all together**

With these fields from an `Image` object, as well as a progress value, we can build back all of the shapes of the `Image` at a given time, as well as any transformations to apply to the shapes, and draw back the `Image` at that frame.  Because the animations are driven by flexible `timing_curves`, a Keyframes `Image` is not limited to discrete integer frames for playback, but it is important to note that all progress values are given in relation to the frame count.  This means a 10 frame animation accepts all values in the range `[0..10]`.
